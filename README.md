## Verilog Mini Projects

A collection of small Verilog modules and testbenches designed to reinforce fundamental digital design concepts. Each project is modular, well-documented, and includes a testbench for simulation. This repository serves as a learning record as I gain skills in RTL design, verification, and simulation.

Throughout these mini-projects, I use tools like **Icarus Verilog** for compiling and simulating and **EDA Playground** for alt simulation and waveform inspection. Projects include both terminal outputs and waveform views for visual debugging and verification.

### Requirements

- **Icarus Verilog** – for compiling and simulating (`iverilog`, `vvp`)
- **EDA Playground** - for alternative simulating and waveform viewing via `EPWave`

---

### File Structure

Each mini project includes:

- `*.v` — Verilog source files  
- `*_tb.v` — Testbench files  
- `problem.md` — AI generated problem statement and bash for compiling/sim
- `results` - Folder that includes images and a final report

---

### Future Goals

To build on this foundation, I plan to expand this repository with more advanced and industry-relevant content, including:

- **SystemVerilog Enhancements**:  
  Incorporating SystemVerilog features for more robust verification and modularity.

- **Synthesis and Physical Design Flow**:  
  Exploring open-source synthesis and layout tools to take designs from RTL to GDS. I aim to simulate and eventually synthesize full custom pipelines.

- **Tool Familiarity**:  
  Gaining fluency with industry tools like **QuestaSim**, **ModelSim**, **Vivado**, and **Quartus** to simulate, debug, and synthesize designs on real hardware (FPGAs and ASICs).

- **Project Scope Expansion**:  
  Creating larger, integrated digital systems such as pipelined CPUs, UART modules, or SoC components—alongside formal documentation and waveform validation.

This repository is a live portfolio and a reflection of my progress toward becoming a skilled RTL and digital systems engineer.
